Multiplication.s is a small mips multiplication program

It will receive two arguments from the keyboard and display the multiplication result in the console window of MARS. If any of the input arguments is a negative number (less than zero), the program should display a zero in the console.

Program2.s

This is a MIPS program that takes one argument labeled “N” and stored in memory, and performs the following:
a) The program sums all the even numbers less than or equal to N, and stores the sum into memory at location labeled “Result”. For example, if N=9, 2+4+6+8=20, so 20 should be stored in “Result”.
b) If N < 2, the program stores 0 in “Result”.
2. The program allows it to receive N from the keyboard and display the result in the console window of MARS. If the input N is a negative number (<0), the program should display an error message “N < 0, invalid for this program!” in the console; and also store -1 in “Result”.
